**Specific Questions**

**(1) Have we made any claims that someone of your own speciality would probably take issue with?**

 +  As you probably guess, I and others in my specialty of Organic Agriculture take issue with the statements about organic certification. See my previous comments.
 + I’m not sure people would take issue with much, especially given that the model is so abstract. The only concern I have is that investment in DPs is assumed to increase the ecosystem state which then benefits the farmer. That assumption is probably ok, but it may be worth noting that not all DPs will end up benefiting farmers. Some may increase services AND disservices, ultimately balancing out or even harming production. I can add in cites for this if you are interested but it might be worth noting regardless in the limitations section. Aside from that, I think that some statements need citations to back them up but I flagged those in the MS. 
 + Yes, comments from Amber on characterization of organics. 
Also, I would focus on ‘environmental incentive policies’ rather than attempting to cover all subsidies, since they can do such different things — and in the simulation we only explore the effects of an environmental incentive policy
 + I agree with Danny's comments here. I also agree with Claire's point on subsidies -- focus on environmental incentive programs (like CSP and EQIP, plus a few sustainable agriculture programs). I had already made a few comments about the reasons why existing subsidy/incentive programs are troublesome for farmers, and these relate to US and CA environmental incentive programs specifically. The idea of a critical period for navigating a tipping point/threshold (ie. the time around the tipping point) is central to the paper's analysis and discussion -- but I don't know if it's been grounded enough in the modeling results explanation or empirical data. It seemed as though it was added to the observations of tipping point behavior. As a transitions researcher, I agree with this analysis (it squares with what we know about the risks of trying to make a transition and the problems that actors can face in getting around entrenched market and production systems). But more grounding might help make the link. Or, it needs to be framed as a hypothesis. Another interesting issue is whether farmers with degraded lands are more likely to go into the simplified state and not to invest in DFS (while farmers with fertile lands are more likely to go into the diversification pathway). I think this is ok for an abstract model and a baby MDP run. But as you will see in several comments, I suspect the actual dynamic is also to do with (1) access to resources and (2) lockedness into dominant production structures - eg. a small farmer with poorer land (as opposed to fertile land) is likely not to have the resources needed to invest into DFS and to survive while transitioning to DFS. The land tenure status and subsidy parts start getting at these aspects. This is for future MDP work, as noted in the final paragraph.
 + I think Alastair caught all the claims that could potentially be controversial with social scientists in his Track Changes. I’m also in agreement with Claire, Danny, and Alastair about changing the “subsidies” language to “environmental incentives” or something similar.  
 + I agree with what Danny wrote.



**(2) Are the parts outside of your specialty clearly explained?**

 +  Yes
 +  In my comments, I flagged some technical jargon that was a bit difficult to follow (e.g., wicked problems, optimal sequential control, etc). The reader could also use a bit more help navigating the conceptual framework of the model in Fig 1.
 + Mostly, see comments.
 + Yes, for the most part. I made some suggested line edits to try to make some bits more easy to 'see' and follow. These are mostly to do with the nature of critical thresholds and alternative stable states/pathways.
 +  Yes. I think if we want to make a big push to engage more non-specialists and highlight the major messages, we could write a piece for an outlet like The Conversation — and I’d be happy to help with that.
 + Considering I have no background in modeling, I think it was well explained. ( I did not delve too deeply into the methods because of this but the bulk of the paper was easy to understand).




**(3) What do you see as the most important message in the paper for your own community of practice? (i.e. the take-aways here for a modeler may be different than for a soil scientist)**

 +  The methods and results from this paper indicate leverage points for policy changes that should be considered (or at least further explored) in order to promote farming with conservation practices. This takes a very theoretical methodology and turns into a tangible and applicable message.
 +  My takeaway is that, under really limited assumptions, most farms will bifurcate into highly diversified and monocultural categories. However, long term subsidies and increased land tenure could help farmers shift to better ecosystem states with more DPs. 
 + The long-term incentive working more effectively to nudge farmers to positive practices. The inherent bifurcation (although we did find this relaxed with other forms of the ecosystem state to action relationship…) - see comment on that.
 + As a policy/social science scholar, the key messages are that -- under really limited assumptions -- thresholds/tipping points do exist and can affect the capacity of farmers to adopt DFS. The bifurcated nature of the model runs are striking and pose a hypothesis that needs to be confirmed through empirical data (which is coming). I don't think policy-makers or social scientists have thought much in terms of tipping points in complex systems. So how policies can support efforts to guide farmers through tipping points toward diversified outcomes is a very good question -- and I am glad that the discussion section really emphasizes policy.
  +  Because farmers approach agroecological transition from different starting points, a diversity of policy mechanisms are needed to help support these transitions ; Investing in agroecological transition now may be cheaper than trying to do it later, after farms/landscapes have passed tipping points ; Secure land tenure and sustained support for agroecological transition is key, because the processes involved (both social and ecological) take place over 5-10 year timescales
 + Farms can end up in either highly diversified or simplified states and this is related to their starting point but can be ameliorated by long term subsidies and increased land tenure.

**(4) What do you think of the current balance of focus? Are we too much 'general CNHS' and not enough 'agricultural systems', or the reverse?**

 +  Balance seems good to me
 +  I actually really like the balance of focus. I do think we need more citations and examples for the agricultural systems side of things. But I really like the framing. 
 + good balance
 + It's a very good balance in my opinion. The agricultural elements are very strong. I would not change the balance.
 + I think it’s a good balance
 + I think it is a little too generalized, but just a little. I think you've kept the paper's main strengths very accessible to a wide group of readers but that adding key examples would make it even more understandable (even to non ag focused people). Especially as this is really focused on ag management, I think it could lean towards ag systems a little more than it currently is. 




**(5) opinion on the title? other suggestions?**

 +  Looks good to me
 +  I like it. Though I do wonder about using sustainable agriculture versus something about diversified agriculture (to be more consistent with the rest of the paper).
 + agree we need standardization of terminology.  I suggest relying primarily on two terms:  diversified, agroecological practices  AND Diversified Farming Systems.  at times use of ’sustainable agriculture’ seems appropriate, but not in title.  have made suggestions throughout
 + I'd eliminate sustainable agriculture and adopt a single consistent terminology, like Claire suggests. I would favor diversified practices (and these need to be briefly defined/identified upfront as I note in my comments).
 + I’m quite sympathetic with the suggestions about using terminology consistent with the main body of the paper, e.g. “Tipping points in the adoption of Diversified Farming Systems” or “Tipping points in the adoption of agroecological practices.” That said, I wonder what terms are being used by the community you are trying to engage here? Are you trying to engage a community that is using the phrase “sustainable agriculture” but isn’t familiar with DFS or agroecology? If so, I could see the logic in using “sustainable agriculture” in the title, then making clear that you are defining this as DFS/agroecology and then using those terms throughout the rest of the paper
 + I agree with the others, maybe using diversified practices in the title would be more consistent




**(6) Can you suggest 1-2 reviewers?**

  + NA
  + You cite John Vandermeer once in here and I think he could be a good reviewer (given that he is both a modeler and an agroecologist). Wei Zhang is also cited- she’s an economist who works on diversified agricultural issues (mostly with pest management). She’s stellar and I think could be good for this as well.
  + Agree with Danny’s suggestion of John Vandermeer — perfect for this. Simon Levin also good from complex adaptive systems perspective. Lucas Garibaldi is a modeler who is also an agronomist/agroecologist
  + John Vandermeer would be great, I agree. What about John Reganold as a more general agriculture science reviewer? It would be good to have a range of perspectives.
 + I agree with others’ suggestions.
 + None other than what has been suggested



**(7)  Please suggest suitable citations where indicated that a citation is needed.  We'd also love additional suggestions for highly relevant literature that we've failed to acknowledge so far.**

 +  I attached the NOP guidance that could be used. I looked for a resource that discloses how much EQIP budget is appropriated and how much has been spent annually, but couldn’t find anything quickly. Mostly, I think there is opportunity for data sharing with the strawberry project if Claire and Kathy think it’s appropriate. I think there will be more confirmation of your results.
 + I added some citation possibilities to the document. I also suggest some places where examples are needed. If you want me to dig up any other citations on the ecological side of things, please let me know and I’d be happy to help!
 + In attached
 + I made a few suggestions.
 + It looks to me like all the gaps have been filled, but again, feel free to reach out if you’re still missing something!
 + NA




**(8) We intend that authorship list will follow the policies we established as a team at the retreat. Please confirm if you would or would not like to be listed as an author.  (We will provide the complete author list with the revised version to get your final approvals before submission).**

 +  I thank you for your offer and will accept .
 + I’d love to be author on this. But I also want to be sure to carry my weight. So do let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help! 
 + Yes
 + I don't need to be listed as a formal author per se. Only if I've made substantial contributions to the paper and have been carrying some weight.
 + Yes, I’d be happy to be an author.
 + I don't need to be an author.(** Jennifer- I emailed her to ensure she knew we felt she has contributed to idea development and that her comments in the manuscript were sufficient. I also told her she could decide after we send up an second iteration that incorporates comments)

**Specific comments**

Lines 88-89

Just a question about the data used—is none of the strawberry project data from Salinas being used? I’m pretty sure that we covered land tenure and DFS practices in our interviews…I ask because there is mention of ongoing work with lettuce growers, but we’ve also been working with strawberry growers in the same region, with the same line of inquiry since 2014 and if this data has not been used, perhaps it could be included somehow in the discussion if the strawberry data supports the lettuce data.

Lines 160-162

I’m struggling with how organic certification is presented here. Currently, the text implies that organic certification basically just grants allowances for substitutive farming and doesn’t require or offer guidance about more holistic farm management that would promote DFS. I actually disagree with this on many counts. I am attaching the most recently published NOP Guidance on Natural Resource and Biodiversity Conservation. It is stated in this document, that in order to be eligible for certification, a farmer must “maintain or improve the natural resources of the operation, including soil and water quality.” It goes further to define what is meant by natural resource conservation:

“Given the broad scope of these definitions, “maintain[ing] or improve[ing] natural resources in organic production” necessarily encompasses a range of conservation principles, including, but not limited to: protecting riparian areas; supporting native species and habitat; minimizing invasive species; maintaining air quality; promoting crop diversity and plant condition; and improving soil condition. This guidance provides examples of production practices that support these conservation principles and demonstrate compliance with 7 CFR § 205.200.”

The rest of the 9 page document offers specific practices that can be used to promote natural resources including soil health. I have highlighted the most relevant practices that would support and promote DFS systems. Given that this guidance is the law that must be followed for certification, it’s not fair to say that organic certification does not offer strategic management of soil health; in contrast, practices that maintain soil health must be used for organic farms and the guidance suggests practices to be used. Even those that are large scale monoculture farms (that make up the heterogeneity in organic that you mention) must rotate crops over space and time in order to protect soil and water quality.

Incidentally, the heterogeneity that is allowed under organic certification, and presented with a negative tone in the text, also allows for the dynamic nature of farming—it allows for farmers to use organic management in all cropping systems and at all scales so that organic food and fiber can enter the supply chain through multiple channels and give more people access than if it were limited to small farms with direct market channels alone. If the certification requirements were very prescriptive, then organic farming would be even more exclusive and even less than the current >1% of U.S. farmland would be under management where environmental standards can be regulated beyond EPA standards (that are rarely monitored or enforced).

So as it goes, even with those players that cheat or take advantage of loopholes, organic certification is currently the best option out there as an enforceable rule that requires the use of farming practices that promote above- and below-ground biodiversity, which cannot be accomplished without promoting some elements of DFS.

Lines 167-169

Perhaps there needs to be a brief distinction between local and absentee landowners. While I agree that long-term lessees will have personal investment in that land if they plan to continue to farm, I disagree that land owners always will, especially if they are absentee. In the Salinas Valley, much land is owned by banks or foreign investors or investors who do not live nearby. These landowners may find value in sustainable agriculture, but my guess is that they will value what retains the value of the land and whatever makes it easiest to manage—especially in regions of California where high value specialty crops are the last thing farmed before the land is developed. “Sustainable” practices that maintain the value of the land vary drastically. For instance, I was told by a farmer that he has grown conventional strawberries in the same piece of land continuously for 14 years! No crop rotation, no cover cropping, nothing. And he’s seen others go longer! He’s able to do that because he can fumigate the soil. He also owns that land, as well as other land that he manages organically…I know another farmer who had a 5 year lease which some consider “long-term” in the Salinas region. He invested a ton of time and money, and utilized conservation programs/incentives to turn a monoculture piece of land into an extremely diversified farm- one of the most diversified that we had in our study. At the end of his lease, the landowners who lived in China, decided to sell the land and since the farmer had added a lot of value to the land, it was out of reach of what the farmer could afford. He lost his lease, his monetary and non-monetary investments in that land, and was put off the idea of using DFS practices on any land he did not own himself. The point of all of this is that the issue of land ownership and values of conservation is very sticky, and the way it’s written about should not take these complexities for granted, or make sweeping generalizations.

I do agree with and like the solutions presented in Lines 177-178.

Lines 188-189

I’m not sure that this is really the crux of the issue. Historically speaking, there hasn’t been a huge slash and burn of the conservation programs appropriations in the Farm Bill. (On the contrary, the Organic Agricultural Research and Extension budget just became mandatory spending with a dramatic increase of funds that far surpass allocations to SARE programs.) I have heard time and time again from multiple NRCS staff across the US that EQIP funding is never fully utilized- they don’t run out of money for farmers who want to utilize this conservation incentive. Which means there has to be another mechanism in place that’s causing the barrier to using conservation program funding, and I don’t think it’s lack of security in the stability of conservation funding in the Farm Bill. Kathryn De Master at ESPM may have a better sense about these barriers as I think she may have explored this in her farmer interviews for the Salinas work.
