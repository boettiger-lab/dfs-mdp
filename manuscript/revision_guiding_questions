blah blah intro please reply to the questions below within two weeks <DATE>

We have written this for a general audience (e.g. Science/PNAS style, or perhaps better framed as 
anyone else who might be funded by / interested in NSF-CNHS calls).   This creates a double-jeopardy we want
each of you to weigh in on:

- Have we made any claims that someone of your own speciality would probably take issue with?
- Are the parts outside of your speciality clearly explained? 

- What do you see as the most important message in the paper *for your own community of practice*? (i.e. the take-aways here
for a modeler may be different than for a soil scientist).  

- What do you think of the current balance of focus? Are we too much 'general CNHS' and not enough 'agricultural systems', or the reverse?

- opinion on the title? other suggestions?

- Can you suggest 1-2 reviewers?

- Please suggest suitable citations where indicated that a citation is needed.  We'd also love additional suggestions
 for highly relevant literature that we've failed to acknowledge so far. 

- We intend that authorship list will follow the policies we established as a team at the retreat.  
  Please affirm if you would or would not like to be listed as an author.  (We will provide the complete author list
  with the revised version to get your final approvals before submission).  
  
- Please reply with your full name and any affiliations (and ORCID if you want it listed).
