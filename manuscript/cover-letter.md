Dear One Earth Editors,

We are excited to submit our manuscript, Tipping points in diversified farming systems for consideration at One Earth. The emergence and impact of tipping points have been of immense interest in both social systems (e.g. crowd behavior, political regime change) and natural phenomena (e.g. ecosystem collapse, climate change). Theories of ecological tipping points have long described this phenomenon in natural systems and explored how ecological management impacts stability landscapes. However, underlying tipping dynamics are generally assumed to stem from the ecological processes. Similarly, economists have pointed to nonmonotonic economic structures and other complex assumptions as mechanisms for observed tipping points in social systems.

In this paper, we show how tipping points in social-ecological systems can emerge purely from the temporal feedbacks between human decisions and their interactions with ecological processes. We leverage interview data to develop a stylized socio-ecological model representing farmers' sequential decisions to adopt agroecological management practices, and the ecosystem services that result from anthropogenic ecological change. We show that bistable systems-level behaviors are not observed if we consider either ecological or social dynamics in isolation but emerge as general pattern by dynamically coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational and forward-looking decision process. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time to accrue, farmers in environments with poor ecosystem services are disincentivized to invest in maintaining them, while farmers in environments with higher ecosystem service value are more likely to bolster those services further. This leads to a bimodal distribution in the adoption of such practices, a pattern supported by a body of literature on 'syndromes of production' (Vandermeer, 2012). Through this integration and consideration for temporal dynamics, we uncover how tipping points arising from the coupling of two simple systems have important implications for policy design over a range of issues, from land tenure to the design of agroecological incentives. 

These findings emerge from a team of social scientists, soil scientists, agronomists, experts in ecosystem services, conservation decision making, and mathematical modeling. Our work underscores the importance of working across disciplinary boundaries to better understand and manage the intertwined socio-ecological systems at the core of many of the pressing issues of our time.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
