Dear Dr. Sacha Vignieri, <br/>

The emergence and impact of tipping points have been of immense interest in both social systems (e.g. crowd behavior, political regime change) and natural phenomena (e.g. ecosystem collapse, climate change). Theories of ecological multistability have long described this phenomenon and explored how ecological management impacts stability landscapes, with underlying tipping dynamics assumed to stem from ecological processes. Similarly, economists have pointed to nonmonotonic economic structures and other complex assumptions as mechanisms for observed tipping points in their study systems.

Emerging from a long history of economics and ecology, a significant body of literature exploring the structure and dynamics of social-ecological systems (SES) has developed  over the past two decades, originally with the goal of addressing how institutional capacity and ecological resilience interact. Since the original descriptive framework for studying SES was published by Berkes and Folke in 1998, numerous alternative frameworks have been developed to study different aspects or typologies of SES, from the robustness of systems to the complexity of multi-tier systems (well synthesized in Ostrom's 2009 Science paper *A general framework for analyzing sustainability of social-ecological systems*). The synthetic field has largely embraced the nonlinearities regularly observed in these systems, working towards understanding the mechanism for complex observed patterns. However despite a rapidly expanding literature exploring the dynamics of coupled human-natural systems, alternate stable states in these systems are often features ascribed either to social processes or natural phenomena alone. For example, Richard Horan's 2011 PNAS paper, *Managing ecological thresholds in coupled environmentalâ€“human systems* assumes that the ecological processes have inherent tipping points. 

In this paper, we show how bistability can emerge purely from the temporal feedbacks between human decisions and their interactions with ecological processes and propose that the mechanisms of these dynamics have important implications for agricultural policy design. We develop a stylized socio-ecological model representing farmers' sequential decisions to adopt agroecological management practices, and the ecosystem services that result from anthropogenic ecological change.  We show that these systems-level behaviors are not observed if we consider either ecological or social dynamics in isolation, but emerge as general pattern by dynamically-coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational decision process over time. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time to acrue, farmers in environments with poor ecosystem services are dinincentivized to invest in maintaining them, while farmers in environments with higher ecosystem service value are more likely to bolster those services further.  This leads to a bimodal distribution in the adoption of such practices, a pattern supported by a body of literature on 'syndroms of production' (Vandermeer, 2012).  Through this integration and consideration for temporal dynamics, we uncover how tipping points arising from the coupling of two simple systems has important implications for policy design over a range of issues, from land tenure to the design of agroecological incentives.  

Beyond the scope of agricultural policy, our approach highlights the importance of accounting for the dynamic processes of ecosystems while also account for the dynamics of individual human actors, who have the capacity to plan ahead. Previous work generally either reduces ecological dynamics to 'steady state', or human decision-making to 'automata', mindlessly obeying simple rules.  

These findings emerge from a team of social scientists, soil scientists, agronomists, experts in ecosystem services, conservation decision making, and mathematical modeling. We  developed a stylized model which is easy to understand, yet leads to some surprising new intuitions. Our work underscores the importance of working across disciplinary boundaries to better understand and manage the intertwined socio-ecological systems at the core of many of the pressing issues of our time.
