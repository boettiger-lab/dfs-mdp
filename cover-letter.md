The emergence and impact of tipping points have been of immense interest both in studies of social systems (crowd behavior, political regime change) and natural phenomena (ecosystem collapse, climate change), but despite a growing recognition of the importance of understanding the dynamics of coupled natural-human systems,

Our work shows how alternative stable states can arise in a stylized socio-ecological model of ecosystem services and the adoption of farming practices which promote them.  This behavior is not observed if we consider either ecological
or the social dynamics in isolation, but emerges as very general pattern of dynamically coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational decision process over time. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time to acrue, farmers in environments with poor ecosystem services are unlikely to invest in maintaining them, while farmers in environments with higher ecosystem service value are more likely to bolster those services further.  This leads to a bifurcation in adoption of practices which promote ecosystem health.  We show how such tipping point dynamics can have important implications for policy design over a range of issues, from land tenure to the design of subsidies.  

Our generic conceptual model has implications for conservation and ecosystem service policies that go far beyond the scope of agricultural practices as well.  Our approach highlights the importance of accounting for dynamic processes of ecosystems -- which need take time to respond to changes in management -- and also account for the dynamics of individual human actors, who have the capacity to plan ahead. Too often, previous work reduces ecological dynamics to 'steady state', and human decision-making to 'automata' mindlessly obeying simple rules.  We have worked closely with a team of social scientists, soil scientists, agronomists, experts in ecosystem services, conservation decision making  and mathematical modeling to produce a stylized model which is both easy to understand and yet leads to some surprising intuition.  Our work underscores the importance of working across disciplinary boundaries in a diverse team to better understand and manage the pressing issues of our time in intertwined socio-ecological systems.
