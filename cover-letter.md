Dear Editor...,

The emergence and impact of tipping points have been of immense interest in both social systems (e.g. crowd behavior, political regime change) and natural phenomena (e.g. ecosystem collapse, climate change). Yet despite a rapidly expanding literature exploring the dynamics of coupled human-natural systems, it is generally assumed that the complex system behaviors, like alternate stable states, are features ascribed either to social processes or natural phenomena alone.  

Our work shows how tipping points can arise in a stylized socio-ecological model representing farmers' sequential decisions to adopt agroecological management practices, and the ecosystem services that result from anthropogenic ecological change.  We show that these systems-level behaviors are not observed if we consider either ecological or social dynamics in isolation, but emerge as very general pattern by dynamically-coupling a simple ecosystem model with a rational decision process over time. Because benefits of ecosystem services take time to acrue, farmers in environments with poor ecosystem services are dinincentivized to invest in maintaining them, while farmers in environments with higher ecosystem service value are more likely to bolster those services further.  This leads to a bimodal distribution in the adoption of such practices, a pattern supported by empirical data.  We show how tipping points arising from the coupling of two simple systems has important implications for policy design over a range of issues, from land tenure to the design of agroecological incentive packages.  

Beyond the scope of agricultural policy, our approach highlights the importance of accounting for the dynamic processes of ecosystems while also account for the dynamics of individual human actors, who have the capacity to plan ahead. Previous work generally either reduces ecological dynamics to 'steady state', or human decision-making to 'automata', mindlessly obeying simple rules. 

These findings emerge from a team of social scientists, soil scientists, agronomists, experts in ecosystem services, conservation decision making, and mathematical modeling to develop a stylized model which is easy to understand, yet leads to some surprising new intuitions. Our work underscores the importance of working across disciplinary boundaries to better understand and manage the intertwined socio-ecological systems at the core of many of the pressing issues of our time.
